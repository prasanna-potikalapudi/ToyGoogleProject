			<h2 class="uppercase">Standard Attributes</h2>
			<p>Attributes may only be specified within start tags and must
				never be used in end tags. HTML5 attributes are case insensitive and
				may be written in all uppercase or mixed case, although the most
				common convention is to stick with lowercase Standard Attributes.</p>
			<p>accesskey : Specifies a keyboard shortcut to access an
				element. align : Horizontally aligns tags background : Places an
				background image behind an element bgcolor : Places a background
				color behind an element class : Classifies an element for use with
				Cascading Style Sheets.</p>
			<h2 class="uppercase">Custom Attributes</h2>
			<p></p>

			<p>A new feature being introduced in HTML 5 is the addition of
				custom data attributes Custom Attributes.</p>

			<p>A custom data attribute starts with data- and would be named
				based on your requirement.</p>
			<p>The above code will be perfectly valid HTML5 with two custom
				attributes called datasubject and data-level. You would be able to
				get the values of these attributes using JavaScript APIs or CSS in
				similar way as you get for standard attributes.</p>
			<h2 class="uppercase">HTML5 Events</h2>
			<p>offline : Triggers when the document goes offline onchange :
				Triggers when an element changes onclick : Triggers on a mouse click
				oncontextmenu : Triggers when a context menu is triggered ondrag :
				Triggers when an element is dragged ondrop : Triggers when dragged
				element is being dropped onfocus : Triggers when the window gets
				focus HTML5 Events</p>
			<h2 class="uppercase">Session Storage</h2>
			<p>The Session Storage is designed for scenarios where the user
				is carrying out a single transaction, but could be carrying out
				multiple transactions in different windows at the same time Session
				Storage.</p>
			<h2 class="uppercase">Local Storage</h2>
			<p>The Local Storage is designed for storage that spans multiple
				windows, and lasts beyond the current session. In particular, Web
				applications may wish to store megabytes of user data, such as
				entire user-authored documents or a user's mailbox, on the client
				side for performance reasons. Again, cookies do not handle this case
				well, because they are transmitted with every request Local Storage.
			</p>
			<h2 class="uppercase">Delete Web Storage</h2>
			<p>Storing sensitive data on local machine could be dangerous and
				could leave a security hole. The Session Storage Data would be
				deleted by the browsers immediately after the session gets
				terminated. To clear a local storage setting you would need to call
				localStorage.remove('key'); where 'key' is the key of the value you
				want to remove. If you want to clear all settings, you need to call
				localStorage.clear() method Delete Web Storage.</p>
			<h2 class="uppercase">Drag and Drop Events</h2>
			<p>dragstart :Fires when the user starts dragging of the object.

				dragenter : Fired when the mouse is first moved over the target
				element while a drag is occurring. A listener for this event should
				indicate whether a drop is allowed over this location. If there are
				no listeners, or the listeners perform no operations, then a drop is
				not allowed by default. dragover :This event is fired as the mouse
				is moved over an element when a drag is occurring. Much of the time,
				the operation that occurs during a listener will be the same as the
				dragenter event. drop : The drop event is fired on the element where
				the drop was occurred at the end of the drag operation. A listener
				would be responsible for retrieving the data being dragged and
				inserting it at the drop location. dragend : Fires when the user
				releases the mouse button while dragging an object Drag and Drop
				Events.</p>
